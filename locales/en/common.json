    "sendyb": {
      "description": "A web app + browser extension featuring a virtual cart system where you can group all your items from different websites. For example, when building a PC with components from Amazon, TopAchat, Leboncoin, etc., you can put everything on the same site and share your cart with everyone. Track how many people viewed your cart and create private carts shareable by invitation. Perfect for YouTubers presenting products who want to track their carts.",
      "adventure": "Sendyb started as a frustration: shopping lists scattered across tabs and platforms. I designed a unified cart with shareable links and a privacy model (invite-only carts). The hardest part was data syncing between the extension and the web app while keeping the UX instant. I iterated on telemetry to understand usage (cart views) and polished onboarding to reduce drop-offs."

      "adventure": "Beatshub taught me marketplace design: balancing creators’ needs with buyers’ expectations. I implemented secure Stripe flows, asset delivery, and moderation tools. The challenge was performance and media handling (waveforms, previews) while keeping fees to zero during launch."
